  ⚠<strong> Information</strong>

Please observe standard Site-75 SCP-████ handling procedures. If organisational structures unknown to you are mentioned in this article it may constitute a Class 1 Bureaucratic-Spread-Scenario. Report to the SCP-████ research head immediately and submit to screening for second-order infection.

<h3 id="scp-">SCP-████</h3>
<hr>
<p><strong>Item #:</strong> SCP-████</p>
<p><strong>Object Class:</strong> Keter</p>
<p><strong>Special Containment Procedures:</strong> SCP-████ should be contained in a standard Foundation secure document storage container. This container should be positioned in the centre of a standard Foundation containment chamber, with all standard containment signage, including construction material ID numbers, removed. This chamber should be secured with three Scranton Reality Anchors. At least two of these anchors must remain functional at all times with the third providing redundancy. Should more than one be offline for any length of time a Class 1 Bureaucratic-Spread-Scenario should be assumed and the Byzantine Protocol (See Document ████-BZ) should be initiated to prevent the manifestation of a Class 2-Malignant-Bureaucratic-Breach-Scenario. Under no circumstances should any document, electronic medium or any written/electronic medium containing text be brought within 500 metres of SCP-████&#39;s containment chamber. Foundation personnel, including D-Class personnel, found to have a tattoo containing text should be redeployed to a different site.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances is any personnel authorised to read, or handle SCP-████. Authorisation from an appropriate level 4 member of staff must be obtained before approaching within 50 metres of SCP-████. Upon receiving authorisation, personnel must spend no more than 30 minutes within 50 metres of the object and then submit to at least 48 hours of quarantine and observation.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-████ is a single paper document in US letter size currently contained in a specialised wing of Site-75 (Site-75K1). The document is roughly 120gsm and is physically non-anomalous, made up of standard cellulose fibres. The document, written in Ecclesiastical Latin, appears to be an order from the &quot;CONCILIUM·SUMMI·IUDICES&quot; (Council of the High Judge/Chief Judges) to begin an investigation into the crimes of the &quot;LAPSI&quot; (The fallen/lapsed). The letter has a letterhead featuring a set of highly ornate crossed keys, similar to those featured on the emblem of the Roman Catholic Papacy. Investigation into the Roman Catholic Church has revealed no organisation called CONCILIUM·SUMMI·IUDICES has ever existed within the Church, or within any known denominations derived from the Church.</p>
<p>SCP-████ anomalous properties manifest whenever the document is read or whenever a medium containing text is brought within <del>100</del> <del>300</del> 500 metres of the document. Almost immediately after being brought within range of SCP-████ documents will begin to feature revisions to their text in order to add in references to committees and sub-committees that the reader should consult or obey. Examples include instruction manuals requesting the user contact various committees and subcommittees before proceeding and emails between personal suddenly making reference to a new committee in Site-75 or the Foundation&#39;s organisational structure that personnel are required to consult. <br>The anomalous effect extends to short pieces of text, such as wall signs, computer serial numbers, and tattoos. In such cases, rather than requesting the individual consult or obey a committee/subcommittee, the text simply states that the aforementioned text is &#39;Endorsed&#39; by a governing organisation. It has been found that texts subject to this effect are found to be easily missed by personnel, who are able to read affected documents without reporting an awareness of the revisions made by SCP-████. When the revisions are pointed out, readers will express surprise and disbelief that they had overlooked the revisions.</p>
<p>When an individual reads SCP-████ or remains in the immediate vicinity (within 100 metres) of the object for for longer than 60 minutes they become subject to SCP-████&#39;s primary memetic effect. Affect individuals will become convinced that the organisation mentioned in the memo exists and that they are an &#39;official&#39; of the organisation charged with investigating the &#39;LAPSI&#39;. This is referred to as a &#39;first-order infection,&#39; and the affected individuals as SCP-████-1. An instance of SCP-████-1 is capable of powerful reality bending in the course of their &#39;investigation&#39;. Instances of SCP-████-1 have been observed to spontaneously unlock doors and containers through the declaration that they have a &#39;search warrant&#39;, and to restrain people through the declaration that they are being &#39;detained by order of the Special Investigatory Committee&#39;. Restrained individuals are compelled to remain where they are despite vocalising a desire to leave. SCP-████-1 will then proceed to &#39;interrogate&#39; individuals through the placing of their hands on the restrained individuals temples. Approximately 70% of the time, &#39;interrogated&#39; individuals will appear to experience extreme pain before expiring. In other instances, the affected individual will be stated to be &#39;eliminated from the investigation&#39; and will then be &#39;deputised,&#39; becoming an instance of SCP-████-1. <br>Due to the capability for SCP-████-1 to propagate at an exponential rate, it is imperative that action is taken to terminate instances of SCP-████-1 as soon as possible. <del>Instances of SCP-████-1 are vulnerable to conventional arms</del>. After the events of Incident-████-08-04-20██ it has been found that instances of SCP-████-1 &#39;discover&#39; more powers available to them the longer they remain active, eventually gaining invulnerability to certain conventional arms. <br>It has been found that Scranton Reality Anchors can slow down the effects of SCP-████-1, but not defeat them entirely. The impact of a single anchor has been found to delay the ability for instances of SCP-████-1 to unlock a door by <del>1 hour</del> 30 minutes, however the use of two anchors has been found to produce a delay of <del>2 hours</del> 1.5 hours. During this time SCP-████-1 will remark that they are having a delay in acquiring a &#39;warrant.&#39;</p>
<p>SCP-████&#39;s secondary memetic effect begins after repeated exposure to documents affected by SCP-████. Over time, individuals will begin to believe in the existence of a complex system of bureaucratic organisations within Site-75 or the Foundation as a whole. This is referred to as a &#39;second-order infection&#39;, and affected individuals as &#39;SCP-████-2&#39;. This often results in decreases in productivity as instances of SCP-████-2 frequently delay making decisions or completing assignments due to having to &#39;consult&#39; with a non-existent committee/subcommittee. The anomalous effect of SCP-████ will increase in strength with continuous exposure to affected documents. SCP-████-2 will begin to report having received orders from non-existent site or Foundation organisations and will be compelled to complete them. These orders range from the mundane (such as replacing the toner in every printer on site), to the nonsensical (removing all of the site&#39;s doorknobs for &#39;cleaning&#39;). Inevitably, instances of SCP-████ will turn violent, resulting in a Class 2 Malignant-Bureaucratic-Breach Scenario, as instances of SCP-████-2 begin to attack other site personnel for &#39;breaching the orders&#39; of their organisation. <br>Instances of SCP-████-2 who are under the early stages of a second-order infection may be treated through a regime of amnestic treatment and eventual redeployment to another site. Once a situation has progressed to the point of a Class 2 Malignant-Bureaucratic-Breach-Scenario instances of SCP-████-2 should be assumed lost and terminated on sight.</p>
<p>Following the events of Incident-████-08-04-20, a new behaviour of instances of SCP-████-2 was discovered, termed a Class 3 Bureaucratic-Ouroboros-Scenario. This behaviour manifests soon after instances of SCP-████-2 number more than 40. [DATA REDACTED - LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED]</p>
<p><del>Research into the relationship between instances of SCP-████-1 and instances of SCP-████-2 are ongoing.</del> Following the events of Incident-████-27-03-20██ it has been determined that instances of SCP-████-2 are an unintentional side effect of SCP-████&#39;s primary memetic effect.
